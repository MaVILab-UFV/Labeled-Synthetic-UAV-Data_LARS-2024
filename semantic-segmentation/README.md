# Render Semantic Texture

This repository contains a Python script for generating images based on drone navigation data in 3D maps in Collada format. The script will also produce JPG images and a text file with the header of the saved images. Additionally, the script generates a preview window of the drone's path.

## How to Run

You should run the script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python script.py /path_to_folder /camera_file /geometry_file /texture_file /robot_config_file /path_to_output_folder
